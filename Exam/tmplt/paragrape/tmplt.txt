They say time is the only thing we can’t get more of, which is why we’re so passionate about finding shortcuts that work.

Let’s face it—whether you fancy yourself a productivity master or not (yet)—we all need a little nudge here and there to help us re-center our day and focus. 

Here are the productivity tips and quotes our Shift Bosses love:

Time block to maximize your day. Spending too much time on each task could cloud your thought process.
“Make everything as simple as possible. But not simpler.” — Albert Einstein
Take regular breaks, and schedule them into your calendar. A walk around the block can do wonders.
Some of us are night owls. Others are early birds. Know your most productive time, and use it wisely. ⏰
“Action is the foundational key to all success.”  — Picasso
Don’t schedule more time than you need for meetings. A lot can get done in 15 minutes! ⌛️
Mute notifications on all of your devices when you need to focus. Head over to the bell on the top left or read this. Read this to learn how to mute notifications in Shift.
“The perfect is the enemy of the good.”—Voltaire
Plan to get one large task, three medium-sized tasks, and five small tasks done every day. A favorite app of ours to help you do this is Todoist, which you can enable right inside Shift.
“Focus on being productive instead of busy.” — Tim Ferriss
